    "1. The accuracies increase with the amount of data being used, especially the amount of correlated features or columns being used, but the increase in accuracy diminishes with the use of more data. The specific ways the accuracies behaved in the models above is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training accuracry was similar when using 5% of the data (0.95) and all the data (0.93) but the validation accuracry was around 14% higher when using all the data (0.94 vs 0.80).\n",
    "This seems to illustrate the fact than when using less data, the model more easily overfits the training data and is less accurate with the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training and validation accuracry was significantly, or around 20-30%, worse when only using the first two columns of features (training accuracy = 0.61, validation accuracy = 0.59) compared to using all columns or 5% of the data in those columns. This could be due to the fact that the first two columns of features are not the only columns affecting if an email is spam and by ignoring the other columns, the predictions are less accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A false positive means that a valid E-mail was seen as spam (1) and a false negative means a spam email was seen as valid (0). A false positive is worse in this case as data like this is often used to filter emails and a false positive means a valid, and maybe important, email would be marked as spam."

For step 3-5, I looked at ML_ex_solution.ipynb, lab 2 and I also prompted chatgpt with \"Create a pandas DataFrame results with columns: Data size, training accuracy, validation accuracy and a for loop to add three sets of data\" and referenced that code to write my own (I had an initial for loope where I was printing three pairs of training and validation accuracies, I referenced chatgpt code to create the dataframe and add the \"size\" variable to the loop.)\n",

The mse value was around 0.1 for both the training and validation datasets which seems acceptable as the compressive strength values are between 2.3 and 82.6 according to https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/datasets/concrete.html, but again the r2 value was too low."

The first pattern is demonstrated by the training and validation accuracy scores of using 5% of the data and all the data. When 5% of the data was used, the training accuracy score was 0.96 and the validation accuracy score was 0.80, which shows that the model was overfit to the training data. Then when all the data was used, the training accuracy was slightly lower at 0.93, but the validation accuracy score was 0.94 which indicates that overfitting decreased and the model's performance on unseen data increased."
